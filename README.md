# Classification-of-different-type-of-Tamtoes-in-Keras

We have six Types of Tomates for classification, here is the data set for link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d9YltIRxn_M6aPymWNxct1ZEvedyHalR?usp=sharing

Just Dowonload the dataset and Upload in your drive and go for it,

A trained model is also attached in here which can be use directly.

Despriction about dataset:::::::::::::

The Fruits dataset is an image classification dataset of various fruits against white backgrounds from various angles, originally open sourced by GitHub user horea. This is a subset of that full dataset.

Use Cases::::::::::::::::
Build a fruit classifier! This could be a just-for-fun project just as much as you could be building a color sorter for agricultural use cases before fruits make their way to market.

Using this Dataset:::

Use the fork button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model's desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better. This particular dataset would be very well suited for Roboflow's new advanced Bounding Box Only Augmentations.
